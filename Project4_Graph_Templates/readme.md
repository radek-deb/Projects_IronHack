## Project Description
The goal of this project was ot prepare templates of 8 diffrent type of graphs in two Python liberies: Matplotlib and Seaborn

In order to do that, I was working with provided dataset - diamonds.csv

## Workflow/Organisation

The project was  realized and followed subseuent steps:

1. Cleaning data from provided dataset.
2. Describe the data using the descriptive statistics
3. Observe relation between diffrent varibale
4. Prepare 8 graphs using the Matplotlib libary (line, bar, scatter, boxplot, piechart, radar, multiple series & 3D)
5. Prepare 8 graphs unsing the Seaborn libary (line, bar, scatter, boxplot, piecgart approximation by barplot, violin chart, jointplot, multiple series & distribution plot)
6. Prepare 2 subplots (one for each libary) with 8 graphs

## Challenges
1. Matplotlib libary: radar chart; creating subplot with 8 diffrent type of charts
2. Seaborn libary: creating piechart, 3D chart and radar chart which are not available in this libary, thus I decided to work with diffrent type of charts

## Results
Ther result of the project are presented in:
- readme.md file | Description of the project and the prcoess.
- jupyter notebook: 1.Data Cleaning | Code which was used to clean the data with comments.
- jupyter notebook: 2.EDA | Descriptive Statistics Review
- jupyter notebook: Graph Tamplate | Graphs which were prepared using clean data
- png files which depict created graphs
